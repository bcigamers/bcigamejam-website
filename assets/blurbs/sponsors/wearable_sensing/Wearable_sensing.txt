Over the past years, Wearable Sensing has developed high-fidelity dry electrode sensors for recording the brainâ€™s electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from the scalp with comparable signal quality to that obtained with conventional medical grade electrodes, but without the hassles of skin preparation and sensitivity to motion or environmental artifacts.  These sensors have been embedded into headsets that are practical to use outside the hospital or laboratory environments.  These practical yet high-fidelity systems are opening the door to translating a wide range of BCI applications to the real- and virtual-worlds.
