                <h3>Game Jam Tips</h3>
                <h4>What exactly is a game jam?</h4>
                <p>
                    A game jam is an event where developers try to make a game as fast as possible, usually in a set period of time like 24 or 48 hours.
                </p>
                <h4>What if I have never designed a game before?</h4>
                <p>
                    No problem! We are open to developers of all levels of experience. 
                    If you have a cool idea for a game or just want to learn a new skill, this is the perfect opportunity!
                    Keep reading the rest of this page and check out our game design basics page for some tips on how to get started.
                </p>
                <h4>What if I don't finish my game?</h4>
                <p>
                    You likely will not finish your game in the 48 hours of this game jam, but that is totally fine! 
                    Commerical games typically take years to develop (plus teams of hundreds of developers and enormous budgets). 
                    Instead of trying to build an entire game, try to focus on building one core piece - you want something that is complete enough that it is playable by the end of the jam.
                    There can (and should) be room to grow and expand on this basic concept at a later point!

                <ol>
                    <li>Go through the resources on our website to learn some game design basics, what a BCI is and how to integrate BCI into your game.
                        There are lots of other helpful videos and resources online that you can check out on game design and tips for game jams as well.

                        Download whatever game engine/software you want to use to build your game. 
                        Check out some tutorials online to get familiar with the engine or brush up on your skills.

                <ol>
                    <li>Don't worry about organizing your code or making it pretty (although do try to leave us some comments so we can make sure your game is playable after the jam!)</li>
