                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <h4>I don't own a BCI - Can I still participate?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes! We have a number of BCI headsets available and will work with you throughout the event to test and debug your game with real BCI systems.
                    Additionally, we look to partner each year with sites around the world to offer some in-person spaces to try out the headsets for yourself.
                    Prizes include new BCI headsets as well, so you can keep creating after the event!
                </p>
                <h4>Can BCIs read my mind?</h4>
                <p>
                    Not at all! 
                    Don't worry, we have no way of reading any specific details or thoughts from your brain activity. 
                    We are only looking for certain patterns that occur in response to different external (i.e., looking at a flashing light) or internal (i.e., imagining movement) events. 
                    Think of it the same way that a mood ring can 'read emotion'- it is just inferring from some physiological response (cold/hot hands), but has no actual insight into the complex infrastructure of emotion.

                <h4>Did Elon Musk invent BCIs?</h4>
                <p>
                    Nope! This research has been going for over a decade with pretty significant strides happening in the last 5 years. 
                    Elon & crew are making great waves though, and helping raise the awareness of what this technology could help do!
