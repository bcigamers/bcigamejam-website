                <h3>Basics of Game Design</h3>
                <h4>New to game design/development? We've got you covered!</h4>
                <p>
                    There are many questions about where to start in the game development journey. Things like: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do I go from what’s in my head to a game (or prototype)?</li>
                        <li>How are games actually put together?</li>
                        <li>How have others making games approached game design topics?</li>
                        <li>What is the first step to getting started? What are good tutorials on building games?</li>
                        <li>Where should I jump in?</li>
                        <li>What engine should I use?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily, there are <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e704e6">tons</span> of resources out there to get you started! 
                    To help narrow it down for you, we have listed a few of our favorites here for some of the above questions. 
                    These are just starting places to get you thinking about game development in general - sometimes long before writing any code or diving into an engine!

                <h4>Getting into the headspace</h4>
                <p>
                    To tackle the first 3 questions above - let’s dive into Game Maker’s Toolkit (GMTK). 
                    GMTK has an excellent series breaking down many concepts surrounding game design, showcasing how existing games or practices can help inform what you’re making. 
                    Here are some key videos and playlists to get you started, but we highly recommend viewing all of them!

                <h4>Your first adventure</h4>
                <p>
                    Now that you’re thinking like a designer, how do you actually get started? 
                    Well the best way to get started is by making some small games! 
                    Maybe some classics like Tetris or Snake, or to just extend a tutorial you find fun to put together. 
                    There are many good sources out there for this, and here we have included some playlists here to check-out and work through.

                <h4>A new journey - accessibility & gaming</h4>
                <p>
                    Great! You’ve got some of the basics down, but what really brought you here is to understand better how to make games accessible. 
                    Accessibility in game design is a growing conversation - and rightly so! More people playing games is always better, and designing with accessibility in mind can create benefits for all players. 
                </p>
