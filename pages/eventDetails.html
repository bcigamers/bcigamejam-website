                <h3>Event Details</h3>
                <h4> Who, What & Why </h4>
                <p>
                    The BCI Game Jam series is the premier game development event focused around building new interactive experiences designed specifically for use with <span style="color: #e704e6">brain-computer interface (BCI)</span> technologies. 
                    Run annually by BCI Games, this event leverages expert knowledge of cutting-edge BCI technology with the creative minds of game development communities around the globe. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="color: #e704e6">Our mission</span> is to build brand new ways to play and create games that are accessible to everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span style="color: #e704e6">BCI Game Jam 2021: Multiplayer Madness</span> will challenge participating developers to incorporate social concepts and ideas into their 48-hour game jam submission. 
                    Cooperative experiences and social connections are deeply rooted in gaming history. 
                    We hope this theme will inspire developers to draw from their fond memories of playing games with friends to provide new players, regardless of physical barriers, opportunities to connect and play.
                </p>

                    If you’ve never worked with a BCI before – don’t worry! 
                    We have you covered. Our network of expert engineers, computer scientists, clinicians, player panels, and families can help you in planning your game, understanding how to design a game with a BCI controller as an input and even provide you some simple tools to get you started with development.
                    Check out our <a id="linktoResources" href="../pages/whatIsBCI.html">resources</a> page to get started!

                <h4> Where & When </h4>
                <p>
                    All of this kicks off on <span style="color: #e704e6">September 24th</span> – where we will have a ‘Day 0’ with talks from BCI experts and actual BCI-users, families of children who use BCI daily, intros to tools and solutions you can use to build your BCI dream game, team formation, and more!
                    The competition officially starts at midnight on <span style="color: #e704e6">September 25th</span> and will run for 48 hours. 
                    We look forward to having a ‘near-after party’ on the evening of <span style="color: #e704e6">September 26th</span> where we will check in with teams, demo submissions, play games and celebrate with the teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This event will be partially held in person (in accordance with current COVID-19 guidelines) at the <span style="color: #e704e6">University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada</span>.
                    The entire game jam will also be available via live stream for any participants unable to attend in person and for participants outside of Calgary. 
                    We welcome participants from anywhere around the world, of any level of experience!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can’t wait to see what you come up with and for you to get your head in the game!
                </p>
