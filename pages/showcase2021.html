                <p>
                    October 2021 saw the continuation of the annual BCI Game Jam, with a renewed focus on multiplayer games! 
                    We had 12 submissions from developers across the world, with many others joining in for the festivities.
                    Many of these brain-controlled games are now available, and are actively being played and enjoyed by the kids in the BCI4Kids program!
